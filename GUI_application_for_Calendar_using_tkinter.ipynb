    "In Python, we can make GUIs using Tkinter. If you are very imaginative and creative you can do amazing stuff with Tkinter. Here, we will make a Python Calendar GUI application using Tkinter. In this app, the user has to enter the year for which he wants to view the calendar, and then the calendar will appear."
